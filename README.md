# Personalized_Bookmark_Assistant
Design personal bookmark assistant, which organizes bookmarks in an automated way and thus saves user’s time for their processing and maintenance. 

Bookmark’s organizing will be adaptive and incremental, enabling smooth additions of new bookmarks to the recent structure.  

To make the system more personal and assistant, it should be able to recommend to a user other Web hyperlinks, which are similar to the already organized bookmarks.
